## 💡 Proposed Solution
We aim to build a **modular, multi-tier web application** for analyzing feedback comments.  
The key features include:

- Process comments individually or in bulk (via file uploads).  
- Classify comments into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiment.  
- Extract keywords, topics, and entities from feedback.  
- Summarize long comments into concise summaries.  
- Provide a **web-based dashboard** for real-time visualization.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach
- **Backend:** Python, Flask API  
- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn, NLTK, Transformers (NLP models)  
- **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, WordCloud  
- **Deployment:** Vercel

1. **Misunderstood comments** → Sarcasm/complex language can confuse AI.  
2. **Badly written comments** → Poor input reduces accuracy.  
3. **AI dependency** → May miss important insights.  
4. **Setup time** → Requires effort to train models initially.
